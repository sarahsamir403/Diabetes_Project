# Diabetes Prediction - Data Science Project

This project is a complete data science pipeline that predicts whether a person has diabetes based on health-related data. It uses four machine learning algorithms to train and evaluate models:

- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Gradient Boosting Classifier  

## Project Overview

The goal is to build a predictive model using medical data (e.g., glucose level, BMI, age) to classify whether an individual is likely to have diabetes. The project follows the full machine learning lifecycle, including:

- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature selection and engineering  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Comparison of algorithm performance  

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data processing and visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (for ML models and evaluation)
